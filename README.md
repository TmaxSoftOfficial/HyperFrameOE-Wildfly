### Installing

#### 1. Download the release-image, usage directory.

#### 2. Build an 'Dockerfile' in release-image directory to make a base wildfly image.

```bash
$ docker build -t <hyperframeoe-wildfly> .
```

#### 3. If you want to modify server configuration or web application configuration, change files in usage/configuration/, usage/deployments directory.

#### 4. Place 'Dockerfile' of usage directory, 'configuration', 'deployments' directory in the same path.

#### 5. Build an 'Dockerfile' in usage directory to make a user setting image.

```bash
$ docker build -t <create image_name>:<image_version> .
```

#### 6. Generate a container using the image created in #5.

```bash
$ docker run -d -p 8080:8080 <image_name>:<image_version>
```
-> gerneral command

```bash
$ docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 9990:9990 -it <image-name>:<image-version> /opt/jboss/wildfly/bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0 -bmanagement 0.0.0.0
```
-> If you want to use management mode, use above command and access 9990 port.
